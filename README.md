Assignments for Udacity Deep Learning class with TensorFlow
===========================================================

Install Tensorflow
-----------------------
Recommend the virtualenv installation. Virtualenv is a virtual Python environment isolated from other Python development, incapable of interfering with or being affected by other Python programs on the same machine. During the virtualenv installation process, you will install not only TensorFlow but also all the packages that TensorFlow requires. (This is actually pretty easy.) To start working with TensorFlow, you simply need to "activate" the virtual environment. All in all, virtualenv provides a safe and reliable mechanism for installing and running TensorFlow.

Please refer to TF official documents: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac

If you met issues due to the updating of you mac version(newer than 10.11), please refer to this: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-turn-off-the-rootless-in-OS-X-El-Capitan-10-11

    
    
Accessing the Notebooks
-----------------------

On linux, go to: http://127.0.0.1:8888

On mac, go to: http://localhost:8888

This repo is just to share some hints for all these fundermental practice of deep learning, please be informed that it's really necessary to understand all the models and do more practice!
