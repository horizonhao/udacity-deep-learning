    "We want to train a LSTM over bigrams, that is pairs of consecutive characters like 'ab' instead of single characters like 'a'. Since the number of possible bigrams is large, feeding them directly to the LSTM using 1-hot encodings will lead to a very sparse representation that is very wasteful computationally.\n",
